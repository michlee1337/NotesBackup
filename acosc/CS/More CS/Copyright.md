        - Ex: MIT OS license
            - requires credit

        - also will release into public domain
    - for government project, will waive all copyright
- As long as licenses are not exclusive, you can give diff licenses to diff people
- Anything we install locally or make needs to have commercial license/ go through staff
- patching external
- check patching
- third party code must be separate from your code
- git-on-borg: internal github
- go/releasing
    - intern mentors responsible
- side projects are discouraged!!
    - anything done on google hours is assumed google work
- copyright infringement requires copying (patent protects functionality)
- must recreate function without copy
    - naming, how you arbitrarily sequence
    - function (math) is not copyright protected
    - content/ implementation is 
    - psuedocode is maybe copyrightable (anything arbitrary is copyrightable)
- go/releasing for new repo, else just go/patching
    - google first party OS project doesn't need review/ approval
- go/patching only for the first patch
- associate google email for my current github account
