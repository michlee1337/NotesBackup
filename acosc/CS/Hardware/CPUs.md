executing steps process
- CPU > Address bus
	- step x of program y
- address bus -> MCC
	- loc z
- MCC -> RAM
	- get loc z
	- MCC -> EDB
		- send data

translating steps
- instruction set
	- hardcoded in CPU

manufacurers
- intel
- amd
- qualcomm


32 vs 64 bit
- memory address, cpu, alu, address/ data bus

selecting
- has to be compatible with motherboard
- land vs pin grid array

necessary
- heatsink

cache
- leveled
- common
	- instruction (exe)
	- data
	- translation lookaside buffer (virtual to physical address)


clock
- one clock wire fire = one clock cycle
- CPU speed = max cycles per second (ex: Q GHz)
- overclocking = going over max cycles
