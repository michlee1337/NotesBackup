- Questions 
    - #question what type of filters are there in envoy? (listener level, l3/l4 <> networking filter <> envoy filter)
    - #question relationship between connection managers and networking filters? does only http have a connection manager?
    - #question reccomended need to know? routing? upstream clusters?listeners? service discovery? <insert documentation index here>
    - #question can't find "extension" in docs? is it a listener filter?
    - #question to build we use envoy as a subdirectory/module? link the new filter and @envoy main entry lib?
    - #question how to change filter using docker image???
- Network Proxy
    - sidecars itself by a host (applicarion code)
- Listeners: one envoy = list of listeners
    - one envoy, many listeners (generally one envoy per machine)
    - each listener has some number of filter chains (each chain selected based on match criteria)
    - each listener can have listener filters as well (processed before network filters)
        - mostly for connection metadata to affect later processing via filters/ clusters
    - filter chain made of
        - filter chain match
        - set of filters
            - each filter is an L3/L4 filter
        - option TLS context (?)
        - den den
    - filters can be read or write
    - also listener discovery service (?)

- TCP proxy
    - envoy is fundamentally a l3/l4 server
    - so l3/l4 proxy
    - 1:1 connection proxy between downstream clients and upstream clusters
    - can be used in conjunction with other filters like mongo (?)
    - will obey connection limits from cluster upstream global resource manager
        - if cannot fit limits, will not make connectoin
    - <config reference>
- UDP proxy supported via the UDP proxy listener filter 
    - #relevant? can we handle grpc the same way
- DNS
    - similar, uses UDP listener DNS filter
- HTTP
    - network level filter: HTTP connection manager
        - translates
        - header sanitizes
        - has route table
        - built on http2 #nani
        - #blahblah connection management retries
    - filters
        - within connection manager
        - types: decoder, encoder, decoder/encoder (related to read or write)
        - envoy has built in router filter
            - #nani reverse proxy request handling
        - last filter in filter stack must be a terminal filter (probably router filter)
        - ordering: decoder in order, encoder in reverse
    - router filter
        - takes incoming req, matches to upstream cluster, acquires connnection pool #nani, and forwards request
    - health checking filter
        - #nani i thought this was "extension"
