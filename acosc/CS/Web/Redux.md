- Purpose: Implements app wide state; enforces strict unidirectional data flow around state
- "Components"
    - Store: Redux store is an abstracted app-wide store; uses [[React Context]]
    - Action: a simple plain object describing what happened
    - Reducer: does something to update store upon action
- Data Flow:
    - you tell store to dispatch action
    - store calls the reducer function associated with action
    - ## root reducer combines reducer state outputs
    - redux store saves complete new state tree
- Never mutate state, always return a new copy of state.
