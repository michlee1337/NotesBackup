- Overview
    - Open Source Build Tool
    - High Level
        - Based on concept of libs, bins, scripts, datasets
    - Multiple language and platform support
- Pros
    - high level
    - fast and reliable
    - multi platform
    - scalability (by # source files)
    - extensible (lang support)
    - Separation of Concerns
    - Functional 
- Workspace, packages Targets
    - Workspace
        - Directory that contain source files
            - contains sym links to build output directors
        - Directories that contain a file named WORKSPACE
            - (ignores directory trees in a workspace rooted in a subdirectory w WORKSPACE since that's a seperate workspace)
        - alias to WORKSPACE.bazel (priority)
    - Repositories (code organized inside it)
        - directory with WORKSPACE file is the root, ie `@`
        - Other external repos are defined in the WORKSPACE file
            - https://docs.bazel.build/versions/3.2.0/be/workspace.html
            - https://docs.bazel.build/versions/3.2.0/repo/index.html
        - ! repositories depended upon transitively are not added automatically. [[?]]
    - Package
        - related files + dependency specs
        - directory containing a file named BUILD of BUILD.bazel
        - should be beneath the root directory in workspace
        - includes everything beneath it, except those that contain a BUILD file
    - Targets
        - elements in a package
        - two types: files and rules (sometimes package groups too)
        - files are made of source files (written by human) and generated files (gen by build tool)
        - rule: relationship between input and output files (+ derivation)
            - output files are always generated
            - input can be human or generated or rule (allows rule chaining)
        - rule always generates files that belong it its own package (rules inputs can come from another package)
        - package groups: set of packages that limit access to certain rules
            - defined by package_gruoup
            - name + list of packages
            - can only refered via visibility attribute of rule or default_visibility attribute of package
            - no generate or consume files
            - https://docs.bazel.build/versions/3.2.0/be/functions.html#package_group
    - Labels: name of a target
        - `@myrepo//my/app/main:app_binary`
            - if ref to repo it is contained it, can leave out the @myrepo
        - my/app/main (package name) + app_binary (target name)
            - if colon left out, target name assumed as package name
        - labels vs packages
            - labels start with //
        - in build file, package name of label and colon can be omitted
            - convention that keep colon for rukes but not files
            - can also refer to files in package by name relative to package directory
    - Lexical spec of labelRules
        - target-name is the name of target in the package
        - rule name is the `name` attribute value in BUILD file
        - name of file is pathname relative to directory containing BUILD file
        - can use / in name of file target but avoid in rule of name
        - name of package is name of directory containing its BUILD file
    - Rules
        - can be one of many classes
        - has set of attributes (see build encyclopedia)
            - srcs: list of targets that are inputs
            - outs: (cannot contain package component), things that depend on the rule
        - can build a build dependency graph out of rules
- Build files
    - loading extension
- types of build rule
- dependencies
    - actual and declared
    - types
    - using labels to ref directories
- 
- 
- Bazel query
    - to analyze build dependencies
