guess something
there may be hidden state vars to use
- ex: [[416 - Partition Equal Subset Sum]]
	- the visible state var to guess is what range of components to use
	- the hidden state var to guess is what the subsum of target-final value is
		- or equivalently: "what is the last component i need"


fundamentals
-   0/1 Knapsack
	-   [[494 - Target Sum]]
-   Unbounded Knapsack
-   Shortest Path (eg: Unique Paths I/II)
-   Fibonacci Sequence (eg: House Thief, Jump Game)
-   Longest Common Substring/Subsequeunce

bottom up is not always better
- [[1048 - Longest String Chain]]

-   subset sum
	-   [[416: Partition Equal Subset Sum]]
-  target sum
	-  [[494 - Target Sum]]
- path sum
	- [[437 - PathSum 3]]
