        - i can only speak for myself, not women.
        - 1) no obligation to engage
        - 2) things are complicated. 
        - 3) equity vs equailty
        - 4) asian americans
        - 5) recognizing presence of inequalities
        - 6) privelege is a difference in opportunity due to uncontrollable factors. different types of privelege (wealth, race, gender, sexuality). privelege is not something to be ashamed of because it is something we have no control over, but consciously rejecting its presence is.
            - having to worry about being perceived as less capable or "just a diversity hire" significantly impacts my ability to work. 
            - being left out of "male work buddy" events makes it harder for me to form connections at work
            - does that mean that more things are standing in my way at work than you? or for a single man vs a single woman? _not necessarily_ but it does mean that women systematically face those worries while men don't. thats systemic inequality.
        - 7) affirmative action is not quotas. quotas are illegal. what is mandated by law is non discrimination based on uncontrollable demographic traits.
        - 8) thinking that the difference in representation is anything other than due to gender inequality is sexist
            - In the U.S., data from the Kapor Center shows high-poverty and high-minority
schools offer advanced placement computer science courses at a rate 12x lower
than wealthier schools with predominantly white and Asian students, resulting in
lower participation rates among underrepresented students. Additionally,
our data shows that Black+ students in the U.S. are less likely to have classes
dedicated to computer science at the school they attend. In the U.K.,
data from the Royal Academy of Engineering shows that 71% of white
engineering graduates find full-time jobs after six months compared with
51% of Black and minority ethnic students. These issues are systemic, and itâ€™s
our responsibility to help address them and invest back into the infrastructure
that supports our growth
        - 9) thinking that competence and diversity are mutually exclusive is sexist
