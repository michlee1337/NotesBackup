academic expectations
- cs class material
	-  explicit and specific constraints around readings, preclass, assignments, and overall course load (ex times, pages - considering accesibility of reading)
- SWE as an available concentration
	- LT: SWE needs way more concentration courses and professors
	- the 162 class needs to be better structured if its an "introduction"
	- FA HCs should include more SWE concepts: communityleverage (reusing, identifying sources of information), abstraction/ seperation of concerns, algorithmic/ data design
	- technical interview labs!


HCs
- HCs need to be considered for transfer to every other school, else why are they general
- cs courses in particular should spend more time considering how HCs can apply to their material

General
- there is no way to thrive at minerva unless you have the finances
	- residence halls are sometimes pretty terrible. wellbeing when you are staying 4/ room or have no deskspace/ light to work considering _we dont have a campus_
	- 100 students per kitchen is unacceptable, particularly considering we have no food program
	- tenderloin is terrible for women and people sensitive to stimuli (for any reason, such as predispositions, past trauma, trouble with sleep, anxiety, etc). not to mention the ridiculous number of assault and harrasment cases reported in the student body.
- "city as a campus" just means what you can pay for as a campus. especially in terms of a work space
	- city engagement/ diversity must include more deliberate engagement and information about the city culture and history, else we are just tourists
- sustainability is pretty bad at minerva
	- moving around so much without guarantee of basic life essentials (pillows and blankets, bowls, containers, cookery) means huge waste at every semester move (because we cant afford the 100s it would cost to ship everything we need)
- more tutorials
- better mental health support (no maximum number of hours)
- transparency and accountability around finances, student welfare, understaffing, and response to student feedback/ requests
