 Why > How contrast reliably reveals activation in the dorsomedial and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior superior temporal sulcus (STS), the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)—
 - independently implicated in representing and reasoning about the mental states that typically drive actions, such as beliefs, desires and intentions

How > Why contrast reliably activates the dorsal and ventral premotor cortex (PMC), posterior middle temporal gyrus (MTG), rostral inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and dorsal precuneus
- regions that have been independently implicated in representing the visual motion patterns and somatomotor features of actions when perceived and performed


Taking as examples the intermediate-level phrases ‘make a phone call’ and ‘contact a friend’, a _why_ question enables an upward movement (‘Why make a phone call? Contact a friend’), while a _how_ question enables the reverse (‘How to contact a friend? Make a phone call’).

complicated by the fact that the language used to represent an action becomes progressively less concrete, specific, imageable, embodied and emotionally neutral as one ascends the levels of the hierarchy
- semantic dimension correlated with increasing levels of a conceptual action hierarchy
- differential demands of conceptualizing the same action at relatively higher _vs_ lower LOAs


Increasing LOAs were associated with the set of left hemisphere regions reliably associated with the Why > How contrast in previous studies
-  the so-called ‘theory-of-mind’ or ‘mentalizing’ network associated with tasks of mental-state reasoning
-  the default mode network (DMN), especially its dorsomedial PFC component
-  the network associated with mentally simulating episodes both past and future
-   network associated with comprehending narrative discourse
-   network associated with transmodal semantic processing
-   network associated with comprehending abstract compared to concrete words


Decreasing LOAs were associated with the majority of the left hemisphere regions reliably associated with the How > Why
- broader functional network responsive to cognitive tasks devoid of meaningful socioemotional content
-  a subset of the functional network thought to enable representation of the visual and somatomotor features of actions when they are perceived, performed, conceptualized, and verbally processed
-  left posterior MTG that has been associated with encoding the visual motion components of action concepts


!! possible question
- abstracting away from sensorimotor experiences (corresponding to increasing LOA in the present study), others have been primarily concerned with understanding the neural bases of relevant conceptual dualisms, such as between embodied and disembodied semantics
- model the onset of the within-trial shift by introducing an optimal amount of jitter between the question and answer onsets
