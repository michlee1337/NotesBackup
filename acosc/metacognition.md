In order to solve problems effectively, we must control, monitor, and self-regulate our thinking.  What we know matters, but how and when we use our knowledge matters even more.  In writing, common errors for students and scholars alike are losing track of the argument and meandering; failing to explain to readers points that are already clear in our own minds; and forgetting to consider the audience for the piece.  In mathematics, students often begin using techniques and strategies they know without evaluating how appropriate those strategies are for the problem at hand.

Taking a social constructivist perspective on learning, Metz addressed this problem by describing the relationship between content knowledge (“conceptual understanding”) and active participation in the norms of scientific culture (“engagement in disciplinary practices”). Following Brown, Collins, and Duguid, who argued in “Situated Cognition and the Culture of Learning” (1989) that knowledge is inextricable from its context and that learning is a process of enculturation in the social and intellectual norms of a discipline, Metz explained that thinking about learning in this way helps students to become independent scholars


Students, particularly undergraduate students, are not simply amassing facts; they are acquiring “disciplinary habits of mind” that provide them with the analytical framework and context in which to use their knowledge.

Most college disciplines involve some problem solving activity — attempts to confront situations that do not have obvious answers or procedures to find answers. Students’ abilities to handle problem solving are dependent on their knowledge base, their problem-solving strategies, their metacognition or self-regulation, and their beliefs about how the discipline is conducted.

[[Social cognitive theory]] holds that “students actively construct their knowledge; that social interaction, collaboration, and participation in learning communities are key to students learning; that academic learning is part of a process of enculturation into a “community of practice”; \[and that there is\] an integral connection between knowing and doing” (see Metz above).

Teaching denotative knowledge and focusing exclusively on content result in less substantial learning for students at all levels. Teaching complex thought processes and the social norms of a discipline results in more robust learning and critical thinking skills and leads students toward becoming independent scholars.


-   Students learn more effectively when they are taught not only content but also problem-solving strategies.  
    Metacognition, the ability to analyze one’s own critical thinking process and to adjust it when necessary, is an essential element of robust learning.
-   Students learn most effectively when they are in a continual process of actively constructing their knowledge.  
    Learning is a communal endeavor that depends on enculturation into the norms of a discipline.
	
	
	Learning is a social activity - it is something we do together, in interaction with each other, rather than an abstract concept (Dewey, 1938).

For example, Vygotsky (1978), believed that community plays a central role in the process of "making meaning." For Vygotsky, the environment in which children grow up will influence how they think and what they think about.

Thus, all teaching and learning is a matter of sharing and negotiating socially constituted knowledge.

For example, Vygotsky (1978) states cognitive development stems from social interactions from guided learning within the [zone of proximal development](https://www.simplypsychology.org/Zone-of-Proximal-Development.html) as children and their partner's co-construct knowledge.
