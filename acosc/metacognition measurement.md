[[direct access vs inferential memory]]
- direct access: perception correlates reality
- indirect: not always	
	- speed
	- ease
	- retrospective confidence


applying repetitive TMS to temporarily inactivate bilateral dlPFC, Rounis _et al._ \[[20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3318765/#RSTB20110417C20)\] selectively decreased metacognitive accuracy while leaving performance on a perceptual task unaffected


 contribution of rlPFC to metacognitive commentary may be to represent task uncertainty in a format suitable for communication to others, consistent with activation here being associated with evaluating self-generated information, and attention to internal representations
 - ‘reality monitoring’ and metacognitive accuracy share a common neural substrate in anterior PFC
 - BA10 and BA46
 - single subject analyses?


 rlPFC is particularly important for the representation of information pertaining to a previous decision in a globally accessible frame of reference
 
 lateral PFC activity is higher in subjects with a strong tendency to avoid cognitively demanding decisions
 
 dlPFC may maintain information about a previous decision, consistent with its role in working memory
 
 
 circuit breakdown
 - TMS to dlPFC impairs metacognition following correct but not incorrect decisions
	 - suggesting a role in representing confidence rather than monitoring for errors
 - In contrast, reporting of response errors has been linked to the error-related positivity [132] with a possible source in insula cortex [118]. Indeed, accurate metacognitive commentaries about performance require access to information about both beliefs and responses
