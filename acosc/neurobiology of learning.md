Kaufer went on to describe several of the biological aspects of learning, including neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. Plasticity, the capacity of the brain to change and develop, is both synaptic and dendritic. That is, changes may occur regarding the connections between neurons (synapses) or in the neurons themselves (dendrites) — or, to put it simply, we can both reorganize our knowledge and change the quality and nature of the knowledge itself. In addition, new discoveries with regard to neurogenesis — the ability of the brain to generate new neurons — suggest that some areas of the brain, including the hippocampus, can birth new cells throughout a person’s lifetime. (This reverses an earlier hypothesis that neurogenesis ends after a certain age, that by adulthood we have all the brain cells we will ever possess and that they slowly die off.) In animal models, Kaufer explained, there are very specific aspects of learning that are dependent on neurogenesis, such as spatial learning and emotional memory. Newly generated neurons are recruited into existing networks, strengthening or developing preexisting connections in the brain.

learning styles

-   Influencing Brain Networks: Implications for Education” (Posner and Rothbart, Trends in Cognitive Sciences 9.3 \[March 2005\], 99–103), which suggested that, although there is strong evidence of brain networks common to all human beings, there are also individual differences due to genes and experiences. The article also suggested that learning seemed to be most effective when learners were “tagging” new information to old knowledge, suggesting that prior knowledge and preconceptions are particularly important for teaching and learning.
    
-   “The Neural Correlates of Visual and Verbal Cognitive Styles” (Kraemer et al., Journal of Neuroscience 29.12 (March 25, 2009, 3792–3798), showed that individuals who identified themselves as visual or verbal learners tended to show activation of different neural pathways while performing learning tasks. In addition, researchers observed a “translation” effect: self-characterized “verbal” learners tended to show activation of verbal-related areas of the brain when performing visual tasks, and self-characterized “visual” learners tended to show activation of visual-related areas when performing verbal tasks. This suggests that appealing to multiple learning styles is useful not in order to cater to each student’s primary mode of learning, as is often assumed, but because cross-connections are created when people perform tasks in a manner different from their “preferred” cognitive style. It’s the variety of brain regions recruited through multiple neural pathways that makes learning most effective for all learners.
