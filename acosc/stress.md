Behaviors and conditions that influence plasticity and neurogenesis include sleep, nutrition, exercise, stress (cortisol levels), and happiness (dopamine levels). Kaufer explained that these exist in dynamic relation to one another. For example, voluntary exercise can counter the effects of stress. Kaufer also explained that the relationship between stress and cognition is a “classic inverted U-curve.”

That is, high levels of stress tend to correlate with low performance — but low levels of stress also correlate with low performance. A moderate amount of stress results in the highest performance. What constitutes a “moderate amount,” however, varies greatly between individuals.

How learning happens:

-   recruitment of multiple cortical areas (and cross talk with the hippocampus) that produces optimized learning with active learning process. Active learning (volitional control) is advantageous for learning because distinct neural systems related to executive functions (planning or predicting, attention and object processing) are dynamically activated and communicate with the hippocampus, to enhance its performance
